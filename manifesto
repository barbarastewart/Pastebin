To me, life is about the big, the small, the fun.  The adventures with friends and the thrill of living.  To travel and explore places you never could dream of.  To try and fail and try again.  To eat your words and spit them out differently.  To fly.  Because if the skyâ€™s the limit, why are there footprints on the moon?
