When I look up at the sky, what meets my eyes?
Can I just stand by while the world dies?
A starship idling nearby… is it my time?
I crawl inside and turn the cockpit clockwise, toward the sunrise
I hear a voice in the back of my head screaming
“This is suicide! Did you hear what I said?”
But then it fades into nothing with the rest of the light and sound
I’m on my way out!
Lift off! The firestorm ignites.
Last thoughts of a life by candlelight
Inside this speeding satellite
Halfway between the black and gray
Is no place for a life to waste away
I’ll take the road with all the stakes
Today, so many moons away
I safely say that my heart’s true calling was never betrayed
Arrays of enemies await, but fears allay
We stand as one. A bond beyond the vast wave, until the last grave
The mission orders typed and lights up our screens
Ignition flights. A thousand minds move simultaneously
Into the night a fleet of firelight jet engines scream. Turn the key
This is my destiny!
Last flight! I’d gladly give my life
For one night as a justice acolyte
Light shines only for the blind
Escape the endless dream of space:
Black seas that I can’t navigate
Locate the great Starlight Brigade
We have come so far,
beyond the most distant star
Starlight within will guide
us to the other side
Lift off! The firestorm ignites.
Last thoughts of a life by candlelight
Inside this speeding satellite
Halfway between the black and gray
Is no place for a life to waste away
I’ll take the road with all the stakes
Black knights and dark side battle cries
All die once they’re in my line of sight
This fight is all I know that’s right
No fate but that of which we make
Noble as the oath we undertake
We are the great Starlight Brigade!
